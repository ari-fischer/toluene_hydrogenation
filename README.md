# toluene_hydrogenation
This repository provides rate datasets, density functional theory output files (VASP), and original codes (Python and MATLAB) that support the results presented in a submitted manuscript entitled:

"Toluene Hydrogenation Catalyzed by Pt Nanoparticles: Kinetically Relevant Steps, Binding Ensembles, and Temperature Effects on Turnover Rates."


A description of the contents, as quoted from the main text of the article, is:

"Density functional theory output files, original codes, and time-on-stream rate data that support these results are publicly available: https://github.com/ari-fischer/toluene_hydrogenation. These output files and codes include: VASP output files for geometry and frequency calculations; Jupyter notebook to calculate molecular area; Jupyter notebook to calculate thermodynamic state functions of gas and surface species from DFT outputs; MATLAB implementation of the numerical model used in regression analysis; and excel spreadsheets containing time-on-stream rate data."
